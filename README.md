### Random Forest Classification in Google Earth Engine - GEE

By using the code [Irrigated Rice Areas Classification](RiceAreasClassification.js) and downloading the [Shapefile archives](Shapefiles) you can perform a Random Forest classification for irrigated rice areas in Turvo city. Also, you can use the follow link [Irrigated Rice Areas GEE - Link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/2ce75e8e35d500b803a56bdedd2f83b5) to perform the classification, all necessaries files are included in the previous link.

To perform the RFE and FSCORE analysis you need to access the follow link [RFE and FSCORE toolbox GEE - Link](https://code.earthengine.google.com/56e7af7a64fbdc0a364cee7b3ec3faa2) or go to the code [RFE and FSCORE toolbox](RFE_FSCORE_toolbox.js) in this shared in this repository.

With the above codes and archives you able to create an binary map with irrigated rice area for 2021/2022 season.
